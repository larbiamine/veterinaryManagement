This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive veterinary management system backend developed using NestJS. The application aims to offer a robust solution for managing various aspects of a veterinary clinic, including appointment scheduling, patient records, and more. Please note that some features such as Treatment Management and Inventory Management are still under development.

## Features

- **User Management**: Allows administrators to manage users with different roles such as owners, veterinarians, and staff members.

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Offers a scheduling system for booking appointments between owners and veterinarians, with options for setting reminders.
- **Inventory Management**: Provides tools for managing inventory items such as medications, vaccines, and medical supplies..

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, adding static typing and other advanced features to the language.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database management system used for storing structured data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
